## 🚛My process

### ⚙️Technologies Used

- SASS/SCSS for efficient styling
- BEM (Block Element Modifier) Architecture for structured CSS
- MVC (Model-View-Controller) Architecture for organized code structure
- NPM (Node Package Manager) for package management
- Mobile-first Workflow for responsive design
- Webpack for module bundling and optimization
- HTML Semantic Tags for structured and meaningful markup

### 🧠What I learned

1. #### **TypeScript**

   Handling unpredictable behaviors in JavaScript, such as uncertainties about function input/output and dealing with `undefined` or `null` types, can be challenging. That's why I turned to TypeScript. With TypeScript, I gain clarity on expected values, making coding easier. Additionally, the built-in intellisense in code editors provides helpful hints, reducing the need to constantly refer to my codebase for information.

   These are the resources that I use:

   - <https://react.dev/learn/typescript>
   - <https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html>

2. **`:focus` vs `:focus-visible`**

   `:focus`

   Selects and styles an element when it receives focus, regardless of how focus is triggered (keyboard, mouse, touch).

   `:focus-visible`

   Style when element gets focus from navigation (keyboard) but not mouse clicks or taps except for `input` elements (Not sure why);

   I use this for accessibility purposes

3. **Unnecessary use of useEffect()**

   I don't have to call `updateToDoItem()` on component mount

   Don't ❌

   ```js
   useEffect(() => {
     updateToDoItem({ ...toDoItem, isCompleted: isChecked });
   }, [isChecked]);

   const toggleCheckHandler = () => {
     setIsChecked(!isChecked);
   };
   ```

   I'm trying to understand why, when I delete an item, the `updateToDoItem()` inside the `useEffect()` works fine when I use `toDoItems` for showing my to-dos. But when I use `filteredToDoItems`, it seems to have an issue. My guess is that when I delete an item, `toDoItems` update first, causing the component to rerender before `filteredToDoItems` get updated. I'm trying to figure out the reason behind this behavior.

   Do ✅

   ```js
   const toggleCheckHandler = () => {
     const newIsChecked = !isChecked;
     setIsChecked(newIsChecked);
     updateToDoItem({ ...toDoItem, isCompleted: newIsChecked });
   };
   ```

   This happens to me alot. Maybe because I'm not knowledgable enough about how rendering works in react

4. **`as` keyword in Typescript**

   Pretty much the same as type casting in other languages like C++.

   C++:

   ```c++
   bool myBool = true;
   int myInt = static_cast<int>(myBool);
   ```

   TypeScript:

   ```typescript
   let myBool: boolean = true;
   let myInt: number = myBool as unknown as number;
   ```

5. **Syling hidden `input[type='radio']`**

   I don't know how many times I came accross with this problem before but now that I use react, it's even worse.

   Don't ❌

   ```html
   <input class="sr-only" name="fruit" id="apple" /> <label for="apple">Apple</label>
   ```

   There's this weird thing happening when I click. The check mark ends up in the wrong place, not where I clicked.

   Do ✅

   ```html
   <label>
     <input class="sr-only" name="fruit" id="apple" />
     <p>Apple</p>
   </label>
   ```

   I found a fix that works for me. I just apply styles to the label when the `input` is hidden using the `:checked + p` selector. This gets rid of that strange behavior I mentioned earlier.

6. **Do not return the same reference to the updater function in useState() IDIOT!!!**

   Don't ❌

   ```typescript
   setToDoItems((prevToDoItems) => {
     prevToDoItems[indexToUpdate] = toUpdateItem;
     return prevToDoItems;
   });
   ```

   Do ✅

   ```typescript
   setToDoItems((prevToDoItems) => {
     const updatedItems = [...prevToDoItems];
     updatedItems[indexToUpdate] = toUpdateItem;
     return updatedItems;
   });
   ```

7. Remove transition on page load
